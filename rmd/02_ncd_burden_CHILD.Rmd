## Table of Estimates for NCD Burden Over Time


```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_ncd_wide <- data_ncd_mini %>%

kable(data_ncd_wide)
```




## Plot Showing Trends in NCD Burden Over Time


```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

ggplot(data_ncd_mini, aes(x = Year, y = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Non-communicable diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "DALY Burden Over Time (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "DALY"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table.

## Summary of NCD Burden Findings

The data and graph indicate an overall decline in the burden of NCDs in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, except in Burkina Faso, which shows a general increase. From 1990 to 2008, Cote d'Ivoire had the highest overall burden of NCDs before being surpassed by Burkina Faso and Ghana, on average, from 2009 to 2020. Among the three countries, Burkina Faso recorded the highest burden of NCDs from 2000 to 2020, while Cote d'Ivoire recorded the lowest burden over the same period..
