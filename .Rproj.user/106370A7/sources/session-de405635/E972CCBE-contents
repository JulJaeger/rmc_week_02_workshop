# Overall Disease Burden

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_overall_mini <-data_overall %>% filter(Entity %in% c("Ghana", "Burkina Faso", "Cote d'Ivoire"))

data_mini_clean <-  data_overall_mini %>% 
  rename(Country = Entity, Daly = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)
```

## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_overall_wide <- data_mini_clean %>%  select(Year, Country ,Daly) %>% 
pivot_wider(names_from = Country,values_from = Daly)
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
kable(data_overall_wide , caption = "Daly Burden over time (Age Standardised Rate)")
```

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
plot <- ggplot(data = data_mini_clean , mapping = aes(x= Year,y= Daly,color = Country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + geom_point(size=2)  +
 labs(
    title = "Trend of DALY Burden Over Time",
    subtitle = "Age-standardized DALY Rates for
    Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Cote d'Ivoire",
    x = "Year",
    y = "DALY (Age-standardized Rate)",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
print(plot)
