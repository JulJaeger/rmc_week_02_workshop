# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)

```{r import dataset, echo=F, eval=F}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))

```

```{r selected countries, echo=F, eval=F}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.

# Chosen countries: Ghana (GHA), Burkina Faso (BFA), Cote d'Ivoire(CIV)

data_cmnn_mini <- data_cmnn %>% 
  filter(Code %in% c("CIV", "GHA", "BFA")) %>% 
  rename(dalys = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)

```

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r table, echo=F}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries.
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.

data_cmnn_wide <- data_cmnn_mini %>% 
   pivot_wider(
    names_from = Year,
    values_from = dalys  
  )

# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
kable(data_cmnn_wide,
      col.names = c("Country", "Country Code", as.character(1990:2019)),
      caption = "DALYS by Country and Year")

```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
```
